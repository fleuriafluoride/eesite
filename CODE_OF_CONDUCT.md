# Code of conduct

## Preamble

This project aims to be welcoming and inclusive of all contributors. As such,
we are committed to creating a safe and positive environment regardless of
gender, ability, nationality or other status.

These rules are split into two parts: the existing rules for the community
server, and project-specific rules that expand upon it.

## Community-wide rules

No harassment or bullying is allowed. Be respectful of other people, and do
not harass or mock anyone based on differences in opinion.

Illegal, sexually explicit, or otherwise inappropriate content is not permitted.
Do not post such content or link to it anywhere within this project.

Do not endanger other people’s security. Do not post any malware that could
compromise someone’s computer or their personal information, and do not reveal
anyone’s personal information, including name, birthday, location,
phone number or other sensitive details, without their consent.

Do not spam. Any bad faith use of this space to interfere with others’ work
is not permitted.

## Project-specific rules

Discriminatory language and hate speech is forbidden. Do not discriminate,
harass or mock individuals or groups based on characteristics like age, race,
religion, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or physical or
mental disability.

Aim to contribute positively to the project. Do not denigrate anyone’s work.
Give constructive criticism, and also accept it for your own work.

Demonstrate kindness towards other contributors. Accept differences in opinion,
and work for the good for the project as a whole, not your personal vision.

## Enforcement

If someone has breached this code of conduct, you can report it to the
maintainer, Fleuria, over Discord (`fleuriafluoride`). The violator will be
privately contacted about the situation, and a penalty will be assessed.

Depending on the severity of the violation, penalties can be
- A warning
- Being temporarily blocked from contributing
- Being permanently blocked from contributing
- Escalation to community moderation. This is only applicable to violations of
  the community-wide rules.
