## How you can help

There are several different categories of documentation: introductions to
mathematical topics, catalogues of common modules and technical references. You
can either write new pages for any of these categories, or edit existing pages.
You can also contribute images and diagrams, with some limitations.

## How to write

Write in a non-emotive, neutral voice.

> (Bad) Vectors are amazing and you need to know about them to make a good
> build.

> (Good) Vectors provide highly convenient calculations, and they may be 
> required for some builds.

Use a descriptive tone. Avoid conversational language.

> (Bad) Let’s talk about the cross product. If you don’t know already, the cross
> product takes two vectors and gives you a third vector.

> (Good) The cross product takes two vectors and outputs a new vector.

Aim to be clear and concise. Your text should be readable to high school
students; avoid excessive jargon, and define technical terms.

> (Bad) The dot product is an inner product of Euclidean space.

> (Good) The dot product takes two vectors and outputs a scalar, ie a number.
